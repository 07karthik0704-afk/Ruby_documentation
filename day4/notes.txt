Day 4 – Ruby Basics Notes

Ruby Data Types
In Ruby, everything you work with is an object. That means even numbers, true/false, and 'nothing' (nil) are treated like objects and have their own methods.
Common Ruby data types:
•	String – Used to store text. Strings are *mutable*, meaning you can change the content after creation.
•	Integer – Whole numbers like 1, 10, 500.
•	Float – Decimal numbers like 3.14, 99.5.
•	Symbol – Looks like :name. Symbols are *immutable* and are commonly used as fixed labels/keys to save memory.
•	Boolean – true and false values (used for conditions).
•	nil – Represents 'nothing' or 'no value' (example: when a variable has not been assigned any value).

Variables in Ruby
Ruby supports different types of variables based on where they can be accessed. You can identify them by their special symbols.
•	Local Variable (name)
→ Works only inside the method/block where it is created.
•	Global Variable ($name)
→ Can be accessed from anywhere in the program (but not recommended much).
•	Instance Variable (@name)
→ Belongs to an object. Used inside classes to store values for each object separately.
•	Class Variable (@@name)
→ Shared across all objects of the class. Same value for every instance.
•	Constant (NAME)
→ Values that should not change. Usually written in ALL CAPS.

Quick Example
name = "Karthik"          # Local variable
$city = "Coimbatore"        # Global variable

class Student
  SCHOOL_NAME = "ABC School" # Constant
  @@count = 0                # Class variable

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name             # Instance variable
    @@count += 1
  end
end
